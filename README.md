# AI Travel Companion ChatBot 🌍

It all began with one simple frustration — planning trips was a mess. I’d be juggling multiple tabs: searching for destinations, checking Google Maps for routes, browsing hotel sites, comparing flights, reading blogs for itineraries, and keeping an eye on the weather. It felt like too much work for something that’s supposed to be exciting.

I thought — what if I could have a single assistant that could do it all?
Not just answer questions, but also help me plan, suggest, and even talk back in real time. That idea turned into the AI Travel Companion ChatBot.

# The vision

I wanted a chatbot that feels like a friend who knows the world. You could ask,
"Plan me a 5-day trip to Bali under ₹50,000"
and it would handle everything — flights, hotels, itineraries, maps, and even give you a weather heads-up.

# What it can do for you

Suggest destinations and tell you the must-visit spots.

Find the best flights and hotels based on your budget and dates.

Build a full day-by-day travel itinerary.

Show you maps, nearby attractions, and travel times.

Let you speak to it and get voice responses.

Keep you updated with weather, events, and currency exchange rates.

# Behind the scenes

The chatbot is powered by AI for natural, human-like conversations and connected to live travel APIs for up-to-date information. It blends mapping, booking, and planning into one seamless experience.

You don’t have to jump between different apps — you can simply have a conversation, and the trip plans itself.

# The future

This is just the beginning. I want to add offline travel guides, group trip planning, AR-based landmark recognition, and expense tracking. The goal is to make this chatbot feel less like a tool and more like a genuine travel partner.
